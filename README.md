GeoFence Ionic App
=====================

This application lets admin define a particular area around user in google maps in the form of a rectagle or a circle.
whenever the user crosses this defined area an alert will be sent to the admin either through a sms or an email.

This app uses geolocation to determine the current position of the user.
